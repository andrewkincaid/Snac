		<h1>Snac Usage</h1>
		<p class="main">After Snac is properly <a href="setup.htm">setup</a>, the actual usage is simple. Note however that the canceling of a scan sometimes freezes the scanner.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Start with making a preview by pressing the preview button (or command-P). The preview is scanned in the selected mode, with a resolution of 50 dpi (or the closest approximation) and using the full scannable area.</p>
			<p>When the preview is done, it will show up in the preview panel.</p></li>
			<li><p>Select the area you want to scan by dragging in the picture and press the Scan button (command-S).</p></li>
			<li><p>When the scan is complete, a save dialog will show up and when the picture is saved, it will open in the selected helper application if that option was checked.</p></li>
		</ul>
